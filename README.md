# PIML_monthly_predictions_JOH
The Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) model can be used for monthly actual evapotranspiration and streamflow predictions. Datasets required are precipitation, root zone soil moisture, groundwater storage, actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow. This model consists of two layers where different ML algorithms are used to predict actual evapotranspiration and streamflow. The actual evapotranspiration can be predicted with precipitation, root zone soil moisture at the previous timestep, and potential evapotranspiration. While the actual evapotranspiration generated in the first layer of the model can be used with precipitation, root zone soil moisture at previous timestep, root zone soil moisture at current timestep, groundwater storage at previous timestep, and groundwater storage at current timestep to predict streamflow as an output of the second layer of the model.
